# Visual Computing Lab

Welcome to **Visual Computing Lab** — a repository dedicated to exploring various experiments in **computer vision using C++ and OpenCV**.  
This project serves as a sandbox for practical implementations and conceptual deep-dives related to visual computing.

## 🧪 Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to:
- Conduct hands-on **computer vision experiments** using C++.
- Understand and analyze the **underlying principles** of each experiment.
- Document and store **experiment-specific concepts** in an organized and reusable way.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: C++
- **Library**: OpenCV
- **Build System**: CMake (if applicable)

```

- Each experiment is stored in its own folder.
- Each experiment includes a `Concept/` directory to describe and explain **key algorithms**, **techniques**, or **OpenCV functions** used.

## 📌 Topics Covered (examples)

- HSV-based masking
- Table (field) detection
- Ball detection and tracking
- Image transformation and perspective correction
- Feature extraction and object labeling
- 3D geometry basics (PnP, reconstruction – future work)

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This lab is a continuous project. New experiments and related concept documents will be added over time.
